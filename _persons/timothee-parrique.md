        Timothée Parrique (pronounced “tea-mo-tay pa-rick”) is a social scientist, originally from Versailles, France.


        He holds a PhD in economics from the Centre d’Études et de Recherches sur le Développement (University of Clermont Auvergne, France) and the Stockholm Resilience Centre (Stockholm University, Sweden). Titled “The political economy of degrowth” (2019), his dissertation explores the economic implications of the ideas of degrowth.


        He is currently writing a book adaptation of his PhD dissertation.


        Tim is also the lead author of “Decoupling debunked – Evidence and arguments against green growth” (2019), a report published by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB). He frequently writes about green growth and decoupling.


        Tim is passionate about heterodox economics, philosophy of science, and academic writing. When not ranting about economics, Tim likes to surf, climb, and do backflips on his mountain bike – yes, it’s possible. (He also spends more time than he would like to admit playing chess online.)


        He blogs at https://timotheeparrique.com and tweets at @timparrique.
