    content: >
        As lead designer, art director and interaction developer, I have been creating interaction principles and leading creative teams to connect design, technology & digital storytelling for the past 10 years. I believe in technology and interaction as the key differentiator that can turn any product or campaign into a meaningful experience.


        I help build interactive experiences and digital stories for desktops, touch devices and installations. Fuelled by an obsession of interaction systems, I aim to deliver thoughtful and challenging concepts through a process of research and development.


        I had the chance to be involved in a wide range of digital projects for recognised brands such as:


        Barclays, Big Mamma, Breguet, Chloé, Citroën, Coca-Cola, Di•r, Devialet, Dom Perignon, Fondation Cartier, Moët & Chandon, Hermès, Infiniti, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Kawasaki, Longines, Nespresso, Nike, Opéra de Paris, Orange, Omega, Paris Saint-Germain, Peugeot, Perrier-Jouët, Radio Nova, The Kooples, Zilli
