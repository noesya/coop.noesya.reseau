        Ben is a postdoc researcher at the University of Vigo's Post-growth innovation lab for the ERC project PROSPERA. He is also an affiliate at the P2P Lab. Ben holds a BA in Business Administration from the Hamburg School of Business Administration as well as an MSc in Ecological Economics and a PhD in Sustainability from the University of Leeds.


        During his PhD research, Ben investigated the role of alternative economic organisations in achieving a degrowth society. A particular focus in his work was on commons-based peer production and digital commons. For PROSPERA, Ben continues to investigate alternative economic organisations in the context of postgrowth and degrowth. His research focuses on how these alternative organisations self-organise internally as well as in networks. Ben also explores alternative ways of innovating and producing without the driver of profit or growth incentives.
