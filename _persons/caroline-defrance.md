        I am a french freelance motion design art director. I currently work with Devialet, Publicis Conseil, Chanel, The Social Client, We Are Gradient...
        I previously work as a Creative Motion Designer, at the global advertising department of Alcatel
        (in Paris and Shenzhen), and before that, for the digital communication agency Dagobert, in Paris.


        For several years, I have worked on numerous projects from creative concept to realisation,
        producing work for clients such as Lacoste, Orange, La Société Générale, Canal+…
        I was in charge of the artistic direction for the departments numerous animation projects.


        With a passion for painting, I studied at the Amiens school of art and design. Here, I developed
        my understanding of aesthetics and enhanced my skills in visual language.
        For every brief I am given, I use this visual language and integrate my passion and experience
        into the project, whilst continuously ensuring the goals of the client are met.
