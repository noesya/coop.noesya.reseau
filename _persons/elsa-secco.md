        Freelance Art Director - Motion Designer


        I am an Entrepreneur and an Award-winning Motion Graphics Designer.
        TedX Motivational Speaker in 2019 about How Motion Graphics can redesign your life.
        Adobe France Speaker in 2019: Masterclass and Public Talk about How to develop your creativity.
        Over the past 10 years I've worked in the film, animation and digital advertising industries, between Sydney and Paris.


        I directed with Jonathan Guyader, the animated music video <a href="https://vimeo.com/158787140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Whelk Song</a>, which won a Vimeo Staff Pick in 2016 and has been selected as Case Study of the week on HOWWW.


        In 2019, Adobe France contacted me to <a href="https://youtu.be/umsaCOsde5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">give a talk</a> (Meet the Talent) about my creation process.


        After the success of the talk, Adobe invited me to give <a href="https://youtu.be/gkfGMeP-UNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">a live masterclass</a>.


        Then, I have worked with a crew of 7 animators on the poetry animation, TED-Ed "Accents" directed by the talented Robertino Zambrano.
        The film won a Cristal for a Commissioned Film unanimously at Annecy International Festival of Animation in 2019 and a Bronze Cube at the 98th #ADC Annual Awards in Motion/Film Craft.
        Have a look at <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/denice_frohman_accents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Accents</a>:


        My skillset is motion graphics, design, illustration, traditional 2D animation, textures, for film, online or TVCs. I love experimenting with new technics and art.


        I have worked for Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Adobe, Ted X, Sony Playstation, Walt Disney, Ubisoft, Fendi, Vogue, HCF, OPTUS, Universal, Commonwealth Bank, Wikileaks, Telstra...
