      Planneur stratÃ©gique Freelance & Intervenante en stratÃ©gie.


      I'm a French girl with a strong accent in love with Strategic Planning, Social media and Manuel Neuer.



      Open-minded, empowered and emphatic, I'm interested in consumer behaviour and brand strategy. Web designer & project manager in a previous life, I was trained to do, create, feel and test. I like to immerse myself totally in unknown worlds. I have this visceral need to grasp the Why and understand what surrounds me - which sometimes opens incongruous doors.
